# Complex numbers
This assigment comprises of applying the basics of python to create your own complex number calculator.

## Task 1:
## Define a class called `complex_number` which accepts 2 parameters:

* x: int64, float64, represents real component of the complex number
* y: int64, float64, represents imaginary component of the complex number

Example, `complex_numbers(3, 5)` means 3 is the real part of the complex number and 5 is the imaginary part of the complex number. Such a number is represented as 3 + 5i.

## Questions:

Define the following operations for the class: 

* '+' (complex number addition)
* '-' (complex number subtraction)
* '*' (complex number multiplication)
* '/' (complex number division)


* Note that these operations should be compatible with `int` and `float` datatypes as well

Also, define the following methods.

* abs() that returns absolute value of the complex number 
* argument() that returns argument of the complex number
* conjugate() that returns conjugate of the complex number
