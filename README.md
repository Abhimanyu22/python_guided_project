Heya budding Data Scientists, today you are going to work along a guided project which will enable you to get answers to questions using basic python concepts. You will learn to get hold of concepts of function and classes in python and how to use it.

## What are you going to do in this project ?
- You are expected to make a complex calculator.
- Your program should be able to do basic operations such as addition, multiplication, subtraction, division etc.


## Pre-requisites
- Data structures
- Working knowledge with class and functions
- Working knowledge of operators in python
- Application of basic mathematics

Note:

* You are not allowed to use any internal `complex number` library or a python package that handle complex numbers.
* You can use other internal libraries if you like.
